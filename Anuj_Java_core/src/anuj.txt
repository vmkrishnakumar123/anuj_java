Polymorphysm- an ability to take many forms

Compile Time (Overloading)-single class


Run Time(Overriding) - sub classes (inhertiance)


Multiple Inheritance


class A 
{

void m()
{
System.out.println("in class A");
}
}


class B 
{

void m()
{
System.out.println("in class B");
}
}



class C extends B,A
{
}

C c = new C();
c.m();
abstraction
abstract method -is a method with out implementation
public abstract int add(int x, int y);  

abstract class   - is class defined with abstract keyword

ab class can have zero or more ab methods 
and can also have concrete method(method with implementtaion)
public int add(int a, int b)  
{
retuen a+b;
}

0-100

interface

functional interface - an interface which has only one ab methods

lamba expression
